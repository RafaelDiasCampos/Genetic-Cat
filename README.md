# Genetic-Cat: Optimizing Hashcat Masks with Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
Genetic-Cat is an optimization tool designed to enhance the efficiency of password cracking using Hashcat. By leveraging **genetic algorithms**, this project generates optimized masks that improve the success rate of brute-force attacks while reducing computational overhead.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Dynamically evolves Hashcat masks for better efficiency.
- **Evaluation of Existing Masks**: Compares Corporate Masks and Extreme Breach Masks against generated masks.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune population size, mutation rate, and generations.
- **Python-Based Implementation**: Built with Python, integrating with Hashcat for testing.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RafaelDiasCampos/Genetic-Cat.git
   cd Genetic-Cat
   ```
2. Follow the steps described in the **Genetic-Cat.ipynb** file.

## Results
The optimized masks generated by Genetic-Cat outperform existing mask sets in terms of password recovery rates and computational efficiency for some password lengths.
